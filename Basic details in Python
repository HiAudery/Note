ðŸŽ‰1. Operators
+, -, *, /, **(not ^), power()
+=, -=, *=, /=, **=

ðŸŽ‰2. Variable names
These are the two syntax rules we need to follow when we're naming variables:

  ðŸ˜„We must use only letters, numbers, or underscores (we can't use apostrophes, hyphens, spaces, etc.).
  ðŸ˜„Variable names can't begin with a number.
  ðŸ˜„Note that variable names are case sensitive


ðŸŽ‰3. Data types
integers, floats, and strings.
int, float, str
Depending on the type, the computer will know how to store a value in memory, or what operations we can and can't perform on a value.
int and float values have different types, but we can mix the values together in arithmetical operations. 

print(float(0)) 0.0
print(int(1.99)) 1
print(round(1.99)) 2
print(round(0.0)) 0

Note that running the round() function doesn't change the value stored by a variable 
personal_apps = round(personal_apps)
gift_apps = int(gift_apps)


# Notice the backslash character in 'Facebook\'s'
motto = 'Facebook\'s old motto was "move fast and break things".'
print(motto)
Facebook's old motto was "move fast and break things".
# The \ character has a special function within a string: it escapes (cancels) the special function of characters. 
# Above, we used \ to escape the second single quotation mark, which had the special function of ending the string.



print('a' * 1)
print('a' * 4)
print('a ' * 5)
print('a' * 0) # No output for this line
print('a' * -1) # No output for this line
