ðŸŽ‰1. Operators
+, -, *, /, **(not ^), power()
+=, -=, *=, /=, **=

ðŸŽ‰2. Variable names
These are the two syntax rules we need to follow when we're naming variables:

  ðŸ˜„We must use only letters, numbers, or underscores (we can't use apostrophes, hyphens, spaces, etc.).
  ðŸ˜„Variable names can't begin with a number.
  ðŸ˜„Note that variable names are case sensitive


ðŸŽ‰3. Data types
integers, floats, and strings.
int, float, str
Depending on the type, the computer will know how to store a value in memory, or what operations we can and can't perform on a value.
int and float values have different types, but we can mix the values together in arithmetical operations. 

print(float(0)) 0.0
print(int(1.99)) 1
print(round(1.99)) 2
print(round(0.0)) 0

Note that running the round() function doesn't change the value stored by a variable 
personal_apps = round(personal_apps)
gift_apps = int(gift_apps)
