🎉1. Operators
+, -, *, /, **(not ^), power()
+=, -=, *=, /=, **=

🎉2. Variable names
These are the two syntax rules we need to follow when we're naming variables:

  😄We must use only letters, numbers, or underscores (we can't use apostrophes, hyphens, spaces, etc.).
  😄Variable names can't begin with a number.
  😄Note that variable names are case sensitive
